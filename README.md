# Smart_Park
 Nowadays in India almost every second family owns a car, and due to rapid increase in population all the free space are decreasing due to rapid construction of residential complexes and industries in cities, which leads to decrease in space for parking.
Due to this, every car driver wastes on average about 100 hours a year looking for a parking space, which accounts for one third of city center traffic. What if we could provide a sensor-controller parking management system that helps optimize the use of urban parking facilities and substantially reduce the congestion caused by motorists searching for a space: our Smart Parking Solutions.
Our Smart Parking Solution will use the full potential of digitalization: Ultrasonic sensors, RFID tags and clever analysis of the available data with the help of cloud computing and IOT in an app based environment. The system eliminates unnecessary parking-related traffic and ensures optimum utilization of urban parking facilities. This saves time, reduces the environmental impact of traffic and improves the quality of life in the city.
